# ninja-downloads
A place for apps that I build to download their needed stuff.


If you are a human, please leave.
Seriously, though.

This is a temporary solution to my auto-downloader. 
It contains any files that could be needed by any projects that I'm working on.

The only reason this exists is because the server that I have in my posession is, well... In my posession.
See, my Internet's terrible. Therefore, nobody can currently connect to said server, and my downloader could never get anything from it.

This may be an abuse of GitHub's effectively infinite storage, but I really need it.

Since you are reading this, you must be a human. 
So LEAVE.
